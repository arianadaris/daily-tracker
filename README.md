<h3>A Python script that helps me keep track of daily habits and sleep schedules.</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>I use a database in Notion to keep track of my sleep schedule, my habits and my gym routines. However, adding to this database daily is a slow process simply due to how many entries are shown on Notion's interface. Additionally, a few fields could be automated to make it easier to log habits. Therefore, I created the above Python scripts.</p>
